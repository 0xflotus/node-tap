A Very Simple test harness that outputs TAP-compliant results.

Usage:

1. Make a directory.  Maybe call it 'test'.  That'd be nice and obvious.
2. Put a bunch of test scripts in there.  If they're node programs, then
   they should be ".js".  Anything else is assumed to be some kind of shell
   script, which should have a shebang line.
3. `npm install tap`
4. `tap ./tests`

The output will be TAP-compliant.

Programmatic usage isn't documented yet.  Poke around the "lib" and "test"
directories for examples.

Support for TODO/SKIP not done yet, but not terrifically hard.
